# Background
Driven by a desire to understand the evolving data analyst landscape, this project leverages data gathered during my SQL Course to pinpoint top-paying roles and in-demand skills. The insights gleaned from this analysis can help aspiring data analysts navigate the job market more effectively.

### he questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?


# Tools and Dataset
This project relied heavily on a suite of essential tools:
* **SQL :** The foundation for all data analysis, enabling me to extract, transform, and analyze job posting data.
* **PostgreSQL :** A robust and efficient database system for storing and managing the job posting data.
* **Visual Studio Code :** My preferred development environment, providing a seamless interface for writing and executing SQL queries, and managing database connections.
* **Git & GitHub :** Essential for version control, allowing me to track changes, collaborate effectively, and share my project with others.

##### Data Integrity :

The foundation of this project is a comprehensive dataset made available by [Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/), a respected data analyst known for his commitment to data quality. This meticulously curated dataset, built over time, provided the perfect springboard for my analysis of the data analyst job market.

# Analysis
My approach involved formulating a series of targeted SQL queries to address key questions about the data analyst job market. This iterative process allowed me to systematically explore the data and uncover valuable insights:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title AS Jobs,
    job_location AS location,
    salary_year_avg AS avg_salary,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_posted_date::DATE AS date,
    name As company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
--adding a left join to enable adding the names of the companies which is in another table
WHERE         
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' 
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT   10
```
**My Findings :**
Analysis of the top ten highest-paying Data Analyst roles revealed a significant salary range. The highest-paying position, offered by Mantys, had an average annual salary of $650,000, while the lowest, an ERM Data Analyst role at Get It Recruit, offered $184,000. This data highlights the substantial earning potential for Data Analysts.

Furthermore, all ten of these top-paying roles were full-time and remote positions.

Finally, the analysis demonstrated a diversity of Data Analyst roles within the top ten, including positions such as Director of Analytics and Principal Data Analyst, indicating a wide range of career paths and specializations available within the field.
