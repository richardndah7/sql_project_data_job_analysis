Findings:
The importance of cloud base tools :
Skills specialized cloud based tools such as Snowflake, Azure, AWS, and BigQuery are widely demanded and
comes with significant salaries which shows a strong importance of cloud plartforms in Data Analysis

Programming skills remains a prioty demand:
Programming tools such as Python and R stand out for recording the highest demand counts with 236 and 148 respectively.

Visualization:
Tableau and Looker, with demand counts of 230 and 49 respectively, and average salaries around $99,288 and $103,795, 
highlight the critical role of data visualization in Data Analysis.
